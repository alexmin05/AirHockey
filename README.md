# AirHockey

The game I created is a simple, but fun classic Air Hockey game. With one user using WASD and the other using the arrow keys, two players can play against
each other in a first-to-5 match. The trickiest part of this game to code was the intersections between the puck, the users, and the goals. The backbone of
the game was completed early, but there was a lot of trouble-shooting that had to happen from that point. Even now, the score is displayed as a double, as
the score for some reason increases by 2 instead of 1 when a goal is scored. With that being said, however, I had fun with the project and am happy with 
the end result!
